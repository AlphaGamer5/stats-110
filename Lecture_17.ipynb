    "\n",
    "#### Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "A random variable $X$ has MGF $M(t) = \\mathbb{E}(e^{tx})$, as a function of $t$, if this is finite on some $(-a, a)$ where $a > 0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that any function of a random variable _is itself a random variable_, so it makes some sense that we can obtain the expected value $\\mathbb{E}(e^{tx})$ \n",

    "#### Moments\n",
    "\n",
    "* the average value for a random variable $X$ $\\mathbb{E}(x)$ is known as the _first moment_\n",
    "* the _second moment_ of $X$ is $\\mathbb{E}(x^{2})$ which helps use derive $\\mathbb{Var}(X)$\n",
    "* higher moments are easily generated (derived), as well\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3 reasons why MGF is important\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $X$ have MGF $M(t)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The first moment $\\mathbb{E}(^{n})$ is the coeficient of $\\frac{t^{n}}{n!}$  in the Taylor series of $M$, i.e., $M^{n}(0) = \\mathbb{E}(x^{n})$\n",
    "1. MGF determines the distribution, i.e., if $X$ and $Y$ have the same MGF, then they have the same CDF\n",
    "1. sums of random variables (convolutions) are difficult; but if we have MGFs, they are _easy_\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sums of MGFs\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have _independent_ r.v. $X$ and $Y$, and we know their respective moment generating functions, then we can easily find the moment generating function for $X + Y$\n",
