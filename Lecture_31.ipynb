    "## What are Markov chains?\n",
    "\n",
    "Markov Chains are an example of a stochastic process, or sequences of random variables evolving over the dimension of time or space. They were invented or discovered by Markov as way to answer the question _Does free will exist?_ However, their application is very wide.\n",
    "\n",
    "Say we have a sequence of random variables $X_0, X_1, X_2, \\cdots$. In our studies up until now, we were assuming that the distributions of these random variables were _independent and individually distributed_. If the index represents time, then this is like starting with a fresh, new independent random variable at each step. \n",
    "\n",
    "A more interesting case is when the random variables are in some way related. But in assuming such a case, the relations can get very complex.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markov Chains are a compromise: they are one level of complexity beyond _i.i.d._, and they come with some very useful properties. For example, think of $X_n$ as the state of a system at a particular and discrete time, like that for a wandering partical jumping from state to state.\n",
    "\n",
    "The indexes or states can be with regards to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* discrete time\n",
    "* continuous time\n",
    "* discrete space\n",
    "* continuous space\n",
    "\n",
    "For this simple introduction, we will limit ourselves to the case of _discrete time, with a finite number of states_ (discrete space), where $n \\in \\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0}$."

    "This means that the future depends upon all of the former states in existence. Very complex.\n",
