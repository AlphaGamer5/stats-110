    "Two gamblers $A$ and $B$ are successively playing a game until one wins all the money and the other is ruined (goes bankrupt). There is a sequence of rounds, with a one dollar bet each time. The rounds are independent events. Let $p = P(\\text{A wins a certain round})$ and the inverse is $q = 1 - p$, by convention.\n",
