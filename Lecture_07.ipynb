    "\n",
    "2 gamblers $A$ and $B$ are successively playing a game until one wins all the money and the other is ruined (goes bankrupt). There is a sequence of rounds, with a one dollar bet each time. The rounds are independent events. Let $p = P(\\text{A wins a certain round})$ and the inverse is $q = 1 - p$, by convention.\n",
    "\n",
    "_What is the probability that $A$ wins the entire game?_\n",
    "\n",
    "Some clarifications:\n",
    "\n",

    "Well, notice how this has a very nice __recursive nature__. If $A$ loses a round, the game can be seen as starting anew at $i-1$, and if he wins, the game would start anew at $i+1$. It is the same problem, but with a different starting condition.\n",
